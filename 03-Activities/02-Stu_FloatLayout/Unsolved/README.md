# Float Layout

## Instructions

- Use the files inside the folder to recreate the layout shown on the screen.

- This will not be easy, but try your best! Ask the instructor and TAs for help if you get stuck.

- If you finish early Slack the TAs or raise your hand to call their attention. TAs will reassign you to help others in the class.

## Hints

- Break down the layout into boxes and think about how to divide your work.

- We've provided some styling to use a starting point.

- Explore some less familiar properties like `padding` and `margin` by using online resources.
